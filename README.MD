There are my sripts for bash.
I`m trying to automate my learnings routine.

1. new_django_project:
- creates venv;
- django project;
- django app;
- requirements.txt
- .gitignore
- .travis.yml
- .flake8
- runs Django server
- inits git
- makes first local commit
- shows several further text instructions

2. test_script is just my bash commands experimantal file can contain anything
